# Causal Inference in Machine Learning

## Overview
- Causal inference refers to the discipline that considers the assumptions, and study design that helps researchers to draw causal conclusions based on data. The causal conclusion refers to the effect of a variable (called treatment) on some outcome. In this project, we will use causal inference techniques to determine, how effective is sprinkler in making the grass wet in Python. The project will also give you context about various causal inference techniques and their assumptions.
  
## What will you learn?
- What is a causal inference?
- Treatment and Control in causal inference
- Causation and correlation
- The framework of causal inference
- The fundamental problem of causal inference
- Basic assumptions
- Simpson’s paradox
- Conditional Probability
- Causal inference technique
- Understanding the Business problem
- Matching Framework
- DoWhy framework
- Direct Acyclic Graphs(DAG)
- Pearl’s Framework
- Matching and DoWhy execution in Python
  
## Aim

- To understand causal inference
- To determine the effectiveness of sprinkle in making the grass wet

## Dataset

- The data is of sprinklers where it contains information about whether the grass is getting wet or not based on specific features. 

## Tech Stack
- Language: Python
- Libraries:  pandas, numpy, bnlearn. matplotlib
  
## The Business Problem
- Is the sprinkler really causing the grass to get wet, or is there another hidden factor like rain?
